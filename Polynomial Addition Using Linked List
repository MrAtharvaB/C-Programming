Polynomial Addition Using Linked List
Overview

This project demonstrates how to represent and add two polynomials using a Linked List data structure. Each term of the polynomial is stored as a node in the linked list, containing the coefficient and the exponent. The program adds two polynomials by traversing their linked lists and combining like terms.

Features

Representation of polynomial terms using linked list nodes.

Addition of two polynomials by merging their linked lists.

Handles polynomials with different exponents.

Displays the resulting polynomial in standard mathematical form.

How It Works

Each node contains:

coefficient (integer or float)

exponent (integer)

next (pointer to the next term/node)

Polynomials are stored in descending order of exponents.

Addition involves iterating through both linked lists simultaneously:

If exponents match, add coefficients and create a new node.

If exponents differ, append the term with the higher exponent.

The result is a new linked list representing the sum polynomial.

File Structure

PolynomialNode.java (or .cpp, .py, etc.): Defines the node structure.

PolynomialLinkedList.java: Contains linked list operations such as insert, display, and add.

Main.java: Contains the main function to demonstrate polynomial addition.

README.md: Project explanation and usage guide.

Usage

Create two polynomials by inserting terms into linked lists.

Call the addition method to compute the sum.

Display the resulting polynomial.

Example:

Polynomial 1: 5x^3 + 4x^2 + 2
Polynomial 2: 3x^3 + x + 7
Sum: 8x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 9
